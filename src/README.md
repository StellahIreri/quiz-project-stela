To enable proper learning online through tests and exams, as well as online written interviews, I have come up with a Web application that gives online quizes, a time limit on each question before going to the next and shows one's results.

After clicking the button "Start Quiz" the user should clicks their choice answer for the first question within 10 seconds after which it automatically goes to the next and finally displays result in % after the last quesion.



Future plans//
To add functionalities such as: exporting of one's results to a downloadable format, adding different modules(for various subject/modules) and including a nav bar for easier navigation throughout the site, authentication
To include open ended answer questions
To improve the website's appearance.
ETC.
